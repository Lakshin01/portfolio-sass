# Portfolio - framework

Goal is to create a customizable framework. with raw scss.

# Setup

Install SASS
https://sass-lang.com/install/

build script

```sh
sass --watch css/scss/styles.scss css/styles.css
```

Why was SCSS chosen.

Scss makes css code highly maintainable.

Why not tailwind?

As we are moving away from css frameworks, its only matter of time raw css catches up in terms of features.

## Features

- Single File SCSS code
- Sticky header
- Landing Page
- Publications
- Projects
- Education
